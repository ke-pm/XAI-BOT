# XAI-BOT
Chatbot for explaining datasets

This project contains the following sub-folders:

## datateller

Our custom dataset which we created for the purpose of the thesis.

## PrefixTuning

The folder contains the orginal source code of [li2021prefixtuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00190) [github](https://github.com/XiangLi1999/PrefixTuning) which we adapted so the method works for dialog generation as well. we also included a cli chatbot to the test the method with.

## DialogPrompt

The folder contains the orginal source code of [gu2021dialogprompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02643) [github](https://github.com/guxd/DialogPrompt) which was adapted for the cli chatbot and training using our newly created dataset.
