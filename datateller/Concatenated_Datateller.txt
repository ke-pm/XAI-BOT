POS tags are labels that indicate the grammatical function of a word in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection. structured data like user profiles, transaction histories, and behavioral patterns, as well as unstructured data such as textual reviews and feedback. __eou__  are there any limitations or biases present in the dataset? __eou__  The dataset is a relatively small dataset, with only around 8,000 sentences. This means that it may not be representative of all the different types of Indonesian text that exist. Additionally, the dataset is not balanced across all POS tags, meaning that some tags are more likely to appear than others. This could potentially lead to bias in models that are trained on the dataset. __eou__  I see. How are the labels or ground-truth generated? __eou__  Labels are generated manually by a team of linguists.
