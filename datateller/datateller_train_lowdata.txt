 What kind of data does the system learn from? __eou__  The system learns from the Visual Genome dataset, which comprises over 100,000 images. Each image provides a rich source of information, including an average of 21 objects, 18 attributes associated with each object, and 18 pairwise relationships between objects. This diverse set of visual elements forms the basis for the system's learning. __eou__  Can you elaborate on any potentionally present limitations ? __eou__  The data might have limitations related to its diversity and representativeness of real-world scenarios. Biases could arise from the nature of the images or the characteristics of the objects and relationships captured. While efforts are made to curate a balanced dataset, it's crucial to consider potential biases in the visual data. __eou__  What data is the system not using during its learning process? __eou__  The system focuses specifically on the visual content provided in the Visual Genome datasetâ€”objects, attributes, and pairwise relationships within images. It doesn't incorporate additional information beyond the specified visual elements. This focused approach ensures the model's accuracy in understanding and interpreting visual scenes. __eou__  How were the labels produced ? __eou__  The labels are generated through a combination of human annotation and curation. Annotators identify and label objects, attributes, and relationships within images, providing the foundation for training and evaluation. This meticulous annotation process ensures the accuracy of the ground-truth values used by the system. __eou__  What is the sample size ? __eou__  The sample comprises over 100,000 images, each contributing a diverse set of visual elements, including objects, attributes, and relationships. __eou__  How much data  is the system trained on? __eou__  The system is exclusively trained on the entirety of the Visual Genome dataset. __eou__
  From which kind of data does the system learn ? __eou__  The system learns from various sources of data such as traffic patterns, air quality measurements, and social media posts related to urban living. The goal is to make predictions about city dynamics and provide insights into urban planning. Is there a specific detail you're interested in regarding the type or source of the data? __eou__  How many items does the system use to make predictions? __eou__  The system utilizes 100k items to make predictions. __eou__  What data is the system not relying on for its predictive model? __eou__  The system doesn't rely on non-urban-related data or information unrelated to city dynamics for its predictive models. It specifically focuses on data sources relevant to urban environments, ensuring the accuracy of predictions related to traffic, air quality, and other urban factors. Is there a specific type of data exclusion you're curious about? __eou__
